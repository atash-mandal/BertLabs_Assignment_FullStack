## About The Project
### Problem Statement:
RyoTen Luxury is a premier platform based in Japan, specializing in the resale of refurbished luxurious goods, high-end apparels, exquisite watches, and other fashion commodities. Their major work is to chunk all the orders (commodities bought by users) from different merchants worldwide and import them in India all together to save the import tax duty. Their unique approach involves not only curating an exceptional collection but also managing seamless transactions between users and merchants globally, ensuring a secure and efficient marketplace for luxury enthusiasts. Design and implement an admin console for RyoTen Lux, or you can say a dashboard for transactions, particularly showing the transaction for each merchant with both frontend and backend:

  - Show the list of transactions, with the following columns
    a. Transaction ID
    b. Merchant Name
    c. Amount
    d. Status (in_progress, success, failed, reversed)
    e. Initiated At
    f. Last Updated At
  
  - And filters on: Merchant Name (partial matches), Amount (range support)

### Built With

Frontend : React.js
           Recharts (Chart.js)
Backend :  Node.js
           Express.js
